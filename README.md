# Image-Tamper-Detection-Using-Hanoi-Based-Block-Mapping-
Image Tamper Detection Using Hanoi Based Block Mapping divides an image into blocks and maps them using a Tower of Hanoi-based sequence. Any modification disrupts this mapping, enabling accurate detection and localization of tampered regions without affecting image quality, useful in forensics, medical imaging, and secure transmission.
